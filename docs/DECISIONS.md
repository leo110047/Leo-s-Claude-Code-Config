# Goldband Decisions

## 2026-07-05: Telemetry v1 and OTLP Export Boundary

Decision: keep JSONL as the telemetry source of truth and add OTLP as an
offline export layer.

Why:

- Hook execution must stay fast, offline, and dependency-free.
- Existing rotation and retention behavior already belongs to JSONL storage.
- OTLP export can be retried, scheduled, or dry-run without changing hook
  behavior.

Implementation contract:

- `scripts/lib/telemetry-schema.cjs` owns the v1 normalizer and validator.
- `schemas/telemetry.v1.schema.json` is the JSON Schema documentation artifact.
- Claude and Codex adapters write `schema_version`, `run_id`, and `event_id` on
  every new usage event while preserving legacy `sessionId`.
- `scripts/export-telemetry-otlp.mjs` reads JSONL and emits OTLP/HTTP JSON. It
  is not installed as a default daemon and does not run from hooks.

Run ID priority:

1. Explicit `run_id` / `runId` from the event.
2. Host hook `session_id` / `sessionId`.
3. Host env: `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` for Claude, `CODEX_SESSION_ID` for Codex.
4. `GOLDBAND_RUN_ID` for explicit caller-controlled export/test runs.
5. `GOLDBAND_RUN_ID_FILE` for a caller-provided per-session marker file.
6. Claude transcript path hash when present.
7. `unknown`.

Codex note: the current Codex manual documents hooks and supported lifecycle
events, but this implementation did not find a public manual section that
documents a stable hook input session field. Goldband therefore treats
`session_id`, `sessionId`, and `CODEX_SESSION_ID` as the local observed adapter
contract. If a session launcher can provide `GOLDBAND_RUN_ID_FILE`, Goldband
will read or create a durable UUID there. Without a stable input or marker file,
it falls back to `unknown` rather than inventing a process-local ID.

Dependency choice: do not add `@opentelemetry/*` packages in this phase. The
OTLP spec supports OTLP/HTTP payloads encoded as JSON protobuf, so the exporter
builds the small traces payload directly. This avoids adding a dependency tree
to a repo whose default install surface does not need exporter runtime code.

External facts checked on 2026-07-05:

- Claude Code hooks reference documents `session_id`, `transcript_path`,
  `cwd`, and `hook_event_name` in hook inputs:
  https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks
- Codex manual hooks section documents hooks, lifecycle events, config shape,
  and command hook behavior:
  https://developers.openai.com/codex/codex-manual.md
- OpenTelemetry OTLP spec 1.10.0 documents OTLP/HTTP JSON-encoded protobuf and
  `/v1/traces` as the default trace path:

- OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions have moved to
  `open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-genai` and are marked Development:
