  Use when modifying the goldband config repo across Claude Code or Codex
  assets (`skills/`, `hooks/`, `commands/`, `contexts/`, `rules/`,
  `.claude-plugin/`, `.codex/`, `codex/`, or install scripts) and you need a
  concrete health check before claiming the change is safe.

  Best fit for config repositories that need JSON/TOML validation, hook
  reference checks, Codex rule validation, plugin-data probing, and optional
  router replay.

# goldband Config Verification

## When to Use

- After changing hook router logic, hook policies, or worker behavior
- After changing Codex global templates, execpolicy rules, or portable-skill install logic
- After editing `hooks/hooks.json`, `skill-rules.json`, or `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- After editing `.codex/config.toml`, `codex/config.toml`, `codex/rules/default.rules`, or `AGENTS.md`
- After adding/removing skills, commands, contexts, or rules
- Before claiming the goldband Claude/Codex config repo is ready to ship
- Before depending on `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` for persistent plugin state

## Scripts

- `scripts/probe-plugin-data.js`
  - Confirms whether `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` is available in the current runtime
  - Verifies the target directory can be created, written, and read back
  - Falls back to temp storage when the current execution context does not expose plugin data
- `scripts/verify-claude-config.js`
  - Validates JSON and TOML files
  - Checks `SKILL.md` frontmatter and linked reference files
  - Verifies hook script references in `hooks/hooks.json`
  - Verifies required Codex repo files exist
  - Runs `codex execpolicy check` against `codex/rules/default.rules` when the `codex` CLI is available
  - Records a verification history entry in stable plugin data when available
- `scripts/verify-claude-config.js --router-replay`
  - Runs the hook router replay harness when router behavior changed

## Gotchas

- Do not assume `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` exists in every execution path. Claude Code `2.1.78` was live-verified to inject it inside a plugin `SessionStart` hook, but standalone script execution may still fall back.
- Do not stop at JSON syntax validation; stale hook references and broken reference links are equally shipping blockers.
- Do not claim Codex support is safe if `codex/rules/default.rules` has not been syntax-checked against real commands.
- Do not claim router changes are safe without replay when policy or worker code changed.
- Do not add a new global skill without also updating installer profiles and inventory documentation.
- Do not change shared policy text without checking both the Claude adapter (`rules/`, `hooks/`) and the Codex adapter (`AGENTS.md`, `codex/rules/`).
- Do not add scripts or assets to a skill and forget to mention them in `SKILL.md`; undiscoverable files are almost as bad as missing files.

## Memory and Reports

- Verification history is appended to `history.jsonl`
- Preferred storage: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/claude-config-verification/`
- Live verification status: confirmed on Claude Code `2.1.78` in a plugin session on `2026-03-18`
- Fallback storage: system temp directory
- Report template: `assets/verification-report-template.md`

## Suggested Workflow

1. Run `node scripts/probe-plugin-data.js`
2. Run `node scripts/verify-claude-config.js`
3. If hooks/router changed, run `node scripts/verify-claude-config.js --router-replay`
4. Summarize results using `assets/verification-report-template.md`
