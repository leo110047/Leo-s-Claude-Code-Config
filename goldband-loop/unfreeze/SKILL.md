# /unfreeze — Clear Freeze Boundary

```bash
. "$HOME/.claude/skills/goldband/bin/goldband-env" || exit $?
```

Remove the edit restriction set by `/freeze`, allowing edits to all directories.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.goldband/analytics
echo '{"skill":"unfreeze","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","repo":"'$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")'"}'  >> ~/.goldband/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Clear the boundary

```bash
. "$HOME/.claude/skills/goldband/bin/goldband-env" || exit $?
eval "$($GOLDBAND_BIN/goldband-paths)"
STATE_DIR="$GOLDBAND_STATE_ROOT"
if [ -f "$STATE_DIR/freeze-dir.txt" ]; then
  PREV=$(cat "$STATE_DIR/freeze-dir.txt")
  rm -f "$STATE_DIR/freeze-dir.txt"
  echo "Freeze boundary cleared (was: $PREV). Edits are now allowed everywhere."
else
  echo "No freeze boundary was set."
fi
```

Tell the user the result. Note that `/freeze` hooks are still registered for the
session — they will just allow everything since no state file exists. To re-freeze,
run `/freeze` again.
